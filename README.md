## RSVP Name Totals
---
> ##### Gordon Wyrostek, Hannah Kim, Violet Dunn

### What is this?
---
This is just a simple program to make a list of name and see the amount of each name are in the list.

### Installation documentation
---
In a JupyterHub terminal, input the command `git clone https://github.com/gcwyrostek/VersionControlLab.git`

This will download a folder called `VersionControlLab` to your terminal containing all the files from the repository.

This folder will contain `RSVP Name Totals.ipynb` which contains the code and `data.txt` which contains the list of names along with the license, code of conduct, and readme.

### Usage documentation
---
When running the code in the `RSVP Name Totals.ipynb` notebook, the user will be prompted to enter a name. Then, the program asks if the name should be added to the list or if the user wants to check how many times a name is present in the list. After, another prompt is sent to ask the user if they would like to continue entering and/or checking names.

### Improvements we're working on
---
Currently there's no functionality to print the entire list out as well as removing names or clearing the list, but that might be added in future versions.

### How to contribute
---
We decided to use GNU GPL3 in order to make sure our project, and projects that use this code, stay open-sourced. Also because it has no warranty, if things don't work right.

If you decide you want to make improvements, please refer to our CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md. It's based on Contributor Covenant's Code of Conduct version 2.1, which covers a lot of general courtesies as well as things we'd prefer to avoid in a collaborative setting.

Please let us know if you find any bugs or want to request a feature!
