## RSVP Name Totals
---
> ##### Gordon Wyrostek, Hannah Kim, Violet Dunn

### What is this?
---
This is just a simple program to make a list of name and see the amount of each name are in the list.

### Installation documentation
---
In a JupyterHub terminal, input the command 'git clone git@github.com:gcwyrostek/VersionControlLab.git'

This will download a folder called VersionControlLab to your terminal containing all the files from the repository.

This folder will contain 'RSVP Name Totals.ipynb' which contains the code and 'data.txt' which contains the list of names along with the license, code of conduct, and readme.

We used the GNU GPL3 license for out project to ensure it remains open-source.

### Usage documentation
---
When running the code in the 'RSVP Name Totals.ipynb' notebook, the user will be prompted to enter a name. Then, the program asks if the name should be added to the list or if the user wants to check how many times a name is present in the list. After, another prompt is sent to ask the user if they would like to continue entering and/or checking names.

### Improvements we're working on
---
Currently there's no functionality to print the entire list out as well as removing names or clearing the list, but that might be added in future versions.

### How to contribute
---
We decided to use GNU GPL3 in order to make sure our project, and projects that use this code, stay open-sourced.
