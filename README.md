RSVP Name Totals
Gordon Wyrostek, Hannah Kim, Violet Dunn

Our program allows users to store the names entered as well as determine how many of each name have been entered in the list.

Please enter a name for the 1st input. It can be a first name, or first and last name.

The second input will determine if you will be adding the name to the list or checking the total instances of the name in the stored list.

Currently there's no functionality to print the entire list out as well as removing names or clearing the list, but that might be added in future versions.

Please let us know if you find any bugs or want to request a feature!
